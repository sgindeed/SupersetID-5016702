Time Complexity
--------------------
Add Operation: O(1)
Adding an employee to the end of the array (if there's space) is a constant-time operation.

Search Operation: O(n)
In the worst case, you might have to search through all employees, making it linear time.

Traverse Operation: O(n)
Traversing all employees involves visiting each element once.

Delete Operation: O(n)
Finding the employee to delete takes O(n) time, and shifting elements to fill the gap also takes O(n) time.
