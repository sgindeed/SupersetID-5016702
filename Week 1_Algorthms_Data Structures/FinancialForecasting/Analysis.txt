Time Complexity
--------------------------------
Time Complexity: O(n)
The algorithm makes a recursive call for each year, resulting in linear time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(n)
Due to the recursion stack, the space complexity is also linear.
Optimization
Memoization: To avoid excessive computation, we can store previously calculated values in a memoization array.
Iterative Approach: Alternatively, we can use an iterative approach to reduce the space complexity to O(1).
