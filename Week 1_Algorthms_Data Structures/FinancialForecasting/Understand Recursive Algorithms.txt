Concept of Recursion
------------------------------
Definition: Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
Structure: A recursive function calls itself with modified parameters.
Base Case and Recursive Case: The base case stops the recursion, and the recursive case continues the recursion.

  
Benefits of Recursion
---------------------------
Simplifies Complex Problems: Recursion can simplify the code for problems that can be divided into similar sub-problems.
Readability: Recursive solutions are often more readable and concise compared to iterative solutions.
