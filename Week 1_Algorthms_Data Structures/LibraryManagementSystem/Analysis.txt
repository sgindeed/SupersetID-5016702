Time Complexity
-----------------------
Linear Search:
Best-case: O(1) (if the target is the first element)
Average-case: O(n)
Worst-case: O(n) (if the target is the last element or not present)

Binary Search:
Best-case: O(1) (if the target is the middle element)
Average-case: O(log n)
Worst-case: O(log n) (if the target is not present)


When to Use Each Algorithm
------------------------------------------
Linear Search:
Use when the list is unsorted or small in size.
Simple to implement and does not require preprocessing (sorting).


Binary Search:
Use when the list is sorted and large in size.
More efficient than linear search for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
